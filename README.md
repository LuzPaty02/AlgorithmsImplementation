# AlgorithmsImplementation

Program that gathers reviewed different sorting and searching algorithms from readings done in Thomas H. Cormen's book "Introduction to Algorithms" and implements them in a csv file that contains information such as time, months and IP adresses.  
The algorithms used were: 

For sorting -> Bubble sort
For searching -> Binary Iterative search
